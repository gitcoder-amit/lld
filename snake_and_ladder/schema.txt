I have figured out these classes and attributes
1 Game--> board, list_of_players, dice
2 Board --> list of cells
3 Cell --> Jump
4 Jump --> start, end
5 Dice --> dicecount
6 Player

how to create schema design for this

Step-by-Step Process
Identify Entities (Tables):

Game
Board
Cell
Jump
Dice
Player
Determine Attributes:

Game Table:

game_id (Primary Key)
board_id (Foreign Key referencing Board)
dice_id (Foreign Key referencing Dice)
Board Table:

board_id (Primary Key)
Cell Table:

cell_id (Primary Key)
board_id (Foreign Key referencing Board)
jump_id (Foreign Key referencing Jump, can be NULL if no jump)
Jump Table:

jump_id (Primary Key)
start (start position of the jump)
end (end position of the jump)
Dice Table:

dice_id (Primary Key)
dice_count (number of dice)
Player Table:

player_id (Primary Key)
game_id (Foreign Key referencing Game)
player_name
current_position
Define Primary Keys:

Each table will have a primary key (e.g., game_id, board_id, cell_id, jump_id, dice_id, player_id).
Establish Relationships:

One-to-one relationship between Game and Board (a game has one board).
One-to-one relationship between Game and Dice (a game has one dice).
One-to-many relationship between Game and Player (a game can have multiple players).
One-to-many relationship between Board and Cell (a board can have multiple cells).
One-to-one (optional) relationship between Cell and Jump (a cell can have a jump).
Normalization:

Ensure the database schema is normalized to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.



Game Table:

game_id: Unique identifier for each game.
board_id: Foreign key linking to the Board table.
dice_id: Foreign key linking to the Dice table.
Board Table:

board_id: Unique identifier for each board.
Cell Table:

cell_id: Unique identifier for each cell.
board_id: Foreign key linking to the Board table.
jump_id: Foreign key linking to the Jump table (can be NULL if the cell doesn't have a jump).
Jump Table:

jump_id: Unique identifier for each jump.
start: Starting position of the jump.
end: Ending position of the jump.
Dice Table:

dice_id: Unique identifier for each dice.
dice_count: Number of dice.
Player Table:

player_id: Unique identifier for each player.
game_id: Foreign key linking to the Game table.
player_name: Name of the player.
current_position: Current position of the player on the board.
Further Considerations:
Indexes: Add indexes on frequently queried columns to improve performance.
Constraints: Add necessary constraints like UNIQUE, CHECK, etc., to maintain data integrity.
Relationships: Ensure all relationships (foreign keys) are correctly established to maintain referential integrity.
