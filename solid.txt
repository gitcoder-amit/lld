SOLID Principles: Simplified Explanation with Example
The SOLID principles are five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable object-oriented software. They make the code easier to understand, extend, and refactor.

ðŸ…‚ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
"A class should have only one reason to change."

Meaning: Each class should focus on one task or functionality.
Why: Reduces complexity, improves readability, and makes maintenance easier.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Bad Example
class Report:
    def generate_report(self):
        print("Generating Report")
    
    def save_to_file(self):
        print("Saving Report to File")
Here, the Report class handles both report generation and file saving, violating SRP.

Good Example (SRP Applied):

python
Copy code
class Report:
    def generate_report(self):
        print("Generating Report")

class FileSaver:
    def save_to_file(self, report):
        print("Saving Report to File")
Report class handles report generation.
FileSaver class handles file saving.
ðŸ„¾ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
"Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."

Meaning: You should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code.
Why: Avoids breaking existing functionality.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Bad Example
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, payment_type):
        if payment_type == "credit":
            print("Processing Credit Card Payment")
        elif payment_type == "paypal":
            print("Processing PayPal Payment")
Adding a new payment method requires modifying the PaymentProcessor.

Good Example (OCP Applied):

python
Copy code
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Payment(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self):
        pass

class CreditPayment(Payment):
    def process_payment(self):
        print("Processing Credit Card Payment")

class PayPalPayment(Payment):
    def process_payment(self):
        print("Processing PayPal Payment")

class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, payment: Payment):
        payment.process_payment()
Adding new payment methods (e.g., CryptoPayment) can be done without changing the PaymentProcessor.

ðŸ„» Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting correctness."

Meaning: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base class.
Why: Prevents runtime errors and preserves behavior.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Bad Example
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise Exception("Penguins can't fly")
Penguin violates LSP because it cannot behave like a Bird.

Good Example (LSP Applied):

python
Copy code
class Bird:
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bird sound")

class FlyingBird(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")

class Penguin(Bird):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Penguin sound")
FlyingBird and Penguin respect LSP by adhering to their specific behaviors.

ðŸ„¸ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
"Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use."

Meaning: Interfaces should be specific to the clientâ€™s needs.
Why: Prevents unnecessary dependencies.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Bad Example
class Worker:
    def work(self):
        pass
    
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Robot(Worker):
    def eat(self):
        raise Exception("Robots don't eat")
Good Example (ISP Applied):

python
Copy code
class Workable:
    def work(self):
        pass

class Eatable:
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Human(Workable, Eatable):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")
    def eat(self):
        print("Eating")

class Robot(Workable):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")
ðŸ„³ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
"Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations."

Meaning: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
Why: Makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Bad Example
class MySQLDatabase:
    def connect(self):
        print("Connected to MySQL")

class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = MySQLDatabase()
The Application depends on a specific database class (MySQLDatabase).

Good Example (DIP Applied):

python
Copy code
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Database(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self):
        pass

class MySQLDatabase(Database):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connected to MySQL")

class Application:
    def __init__(self, db: Database):
        self.db = db

app = Application(MySQLDatabase())
app.db.connect()
Now, Application depends on an abstract Database interface, making it flexible.

ðŸŽ¯ Quick Recap:
S - Single Responsibility: One class, one responsibility.
O - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution: Subclasses should replace base classes seamlessly.
I - Interface Segregation: No unnecessary dependencies.
D - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations.
